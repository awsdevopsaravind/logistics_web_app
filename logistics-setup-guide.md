## Phase 1: Project Initialization (Day 1 - 2 hours)

### Step 1: Create New Project in Cursor
1. Open Cursor IDE
2. Create new folder: `logistics-management-system`
3. Use this AI prompt:

```
I need to create a logistics management system for my rock transportation business in India. Here are my requirements:

BUSINESS MODEL:
- I transport rocks from quarries to fishing harbors (50-60km distance)
- Payment based on tonnage from kaata receipts
- I pay: quarry owners (₹170-190/ton), vehicle owners (₹270-290/ton), government royalty (₹235-255/cubic meter)
- I receive: ₹645/ton from company
- Need to track advances, outstanding payments, profit/loss

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- React.js frontend with modern dashboard
- Node.js/Express backend
- PostgreSQL database
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- Excel import/export functionality

Please create the complete project structure with package.json files for both frontend and backend.
```

### Step 2: Database Schema Design
Use this prompt:
```
Create a PostgreSQL database schema for my logistics business with these entities:
- Trips (trip_id, date, vehicle_id, driver_name, quarry_id, destination, tonnage, kaata_receipt_no)
- Quarries (quarry_id, name, location, rate_per_ton, contact)
- Vehicles (vehicle_id, owner_name, vehicle_no, rate_per_ton, contact)
- Payments (payment_id, type, amount, date, trip_id, status)
- Government_Royalty (royalty_id, cubic_meters_purchased, rate_per_cubic_meter, balance, purchase_date)
- Advances (advance_id, recipient_type, recipient_id, amount, date, status)

Include all necessary relationships and constraints.
```

## Phase 2: Backend Development (Day 2-4)

### Step 3: API Development
Use this prompt:
```
